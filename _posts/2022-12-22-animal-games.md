excerpt: "In this spreadsheet, I try to list all the video games in which you can play as an animal, anthropomorphic or otherwise. My principal interest is those in which the species matters to the gameplay. Realistic animal depictions are labeled as xeno. Anthropomorphic animal depictions are labeled as anthro. Games in which characters have animal features solely for the aesthetic are labeled as furry. The hierarchy is like so: Xeno (Most Animalistic) > Anthro (Less Animalistic) > Furry (Just Aesthetics)."
